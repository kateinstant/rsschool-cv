        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p> <em>I am 33 years old. During the decree, I studied Adobe photoshop and freelance photo processing. Later I wanted to take up photography, and I went to the courses "Creative Photography". I participate in various world photo contests, where I have won small victories several times. Photography has become my hobby. Now I decided to study programming because I want to constantly develop, be free and move only forward. I believe that I will succeed thanks to rs school and my self-learning skill</em> </p>
